# Migros Me

## Inspiration
We believe when it comes to Nutrition; our supermarket knows better, not some random health App. We wanted to create a much more robust ecosystem for nutrition planning where customers have more control over their health plan by accessing better data about their food.

## What it does
Migros Me is a nutrition ecosystem run by Migros where customers can find all information about the food they consume, its helps them create better nutrition planning, auto order food they need.

## How I built it
We used Kotlin which is a cross-platform, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, we also used the Huawei Mobile Services to deploy our App. Through to the App we used some of the more robust navigation ways, such as Tinder-like swiping through the recipes, we used some of the product data to build an finial list of recipes the user can interact with.
